<page>To embed Apacheâ„¢ FOP in your application, first create a new org.apache.fop.apps.FopFactory instance. This object
    can be used to launch multiple rendering runs. For each run, create a new org.apache.fop.apps.Fop instance through
    one of the factory methods of FopFactory. In the method call you specify which output format (i.e. MIME type) to use
    and, if the selected output format requires an OutputStream, which OutputStream to use for the results of the
    rendering. You can customize FOP's behaviour in a rendering run by supplying your own FOUserAgent instance. The
    FOUserAgent can, for example, be used to set your own document handler instance (details below). Finally, you
    retrieve a SAX DefaultHandler instance from the Fop object and use that as the SAXResult of your transformation.
